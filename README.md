# Discord-grabber
This is a Discord info grabber and keylogger. It can be used to to steal discord account's and it is added to startup for persistence.

Here is a list of what you need to do:

pip install's: requests, pynput, pyperclip, pycryptodome, psutil, pywin32.

Replace webhook url with the one you want the info to be sent to.

You would want to change the rename of the startup.

Then you need to compile the code with auto_py_to_exe.

And then its ready for use.

I might upgrade this info grabber in the future.

I am not responsible for any misuse of this code.
