# Discord-grabber
This is a Discord info grabber and keylogger. It can be used to to steal discord account's and it is added to startup for persistence.

Here is a list of what you need to do:

pip install's:

requests
pynput
pyperclip
pycryptodome
psutil
pywin32
Steps:

Replace the webhook URL with the one you want the info to be sent to.
Change the rename of the startup.
Compile the code with auto-py-to-exe.
Itâ€™s ready for use.
Note:
I might upgrade this info grabber in the future.
